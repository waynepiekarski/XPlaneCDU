Privacy policy for Google Play

This application is open source, released under the GNU Public License version 3 (GPLv3).

This application does not capture or upload any personally identifiable information. It makes a
connection to X-Plane via a plugin interface, and only saves a manual IP address via the
Android SharedPreferences API. No information is visible to the developer or uploaded
to the internet. This application contains no ads, logging, telemetry, or anything else
undesirable, it is truly free in both price and user freedom.

I hope you enjoy this free open source application for your X-Plane flight simulator.
