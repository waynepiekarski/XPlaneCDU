XPlaneCDU is a remote control interface for the Control Display Unit (CDU) present in X-Plane 11. This app does not provide an FMS, but simply a way to control the existing CDU from an Android tablet or phone. Currently it works with the Zibo Boeing 738 or SSG 748 aircraft.

You can download the app directly to your Android device from the Google Play store: 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.waynepiekarski.xplanecdu

This application is open source, released under the GNU Public License version 3 (GPLv3). It is written in Kotlin and shows how to implement the complex screen layout on any device size.

You must have the ExtPanel v2 plugin installed in your X-Plane 11 Resources/plugins directory. This plugin uses port 51000 to provide external control capabilities. You can download the binaries for the plugin from http://waynepiekarski.net/extplane and the corresponding source code from https://github.com/waynepiekarski/XPlaneCDU ... it is a build of the original code at https://github.com/vranki/ExtPlane (licensed under GPLv3).

It should be possible to extend XPlaneCDU to work with other aircraft, but it must provide datarefs for the CDU text strings. The default X-Plane 737 does not support this, and every other payware aircraft uses non-standard datarefs. It should be possible to support the Flight Factor 757/767, but they already provide a web-based CDU.

This is an early prototype and I look forward to feedback on any problems. File bugs or comments here on GitHub.
